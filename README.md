Lo-Fi combines ESP32S3 with LoRa to establish long-range wireless communication in challenging situations in addition to WiFi and BLE capabilities. With LoRa's great range and simple connectivity, you can talk with devices up to 5 km distant with ease. Device is available in three supported frequencies - 433MHz, 868MHz, and 915MHz bands for LoRa applications.

This GitHub page offers a step-by-step tutorial for using Lo-Fi. 

### Features : 
- Device powered by powerful ESP32 S3 WROOM-1 which is having XtensaÂ® dual-core 32-bit LX7 microprocessor, up to 240 MHz 
- Inbuilt Wi-Fi & Bluetooth LE for wireless connectivity
- Type C interface for Programming/Power 
- 1.14" TFT display with resolution 135 x 240 pixels for visual interactions
- GPIO breakouts for interfacing additional peripherals 
- Breadboard compatible for easy DIY breadboarding projects
- 2 separate user programmable buttons along with Reset and Boot buttons
- 3.7V Lithium Battery connector for portable use case with onboard charging option
- Use new generation LoRa spread spectrum to ensure stable communication
- LoRa supports data rate up to 62.5kbps  and a longer data transmission range of up to 5 km

### 1. Configure and Setup Development Environment
   - Download Arduino IDE from [official site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and install into your system. We have use Arduino IDE 1.8.19
   - Once installation done will add ESP32 S3 board support into IDE, for this first you need to add below link into preference:
     
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
     
     Select File > Preference, and add link as show in below image,
      <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/preference_board.gif"/>
      
   - Now will install ESP32 based boards as shown in below image,

      <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/3.2_Touchsy_ESP-32_Resistive_Software/blob/main/images/install_ESP32boards.gif"/>
     
   - Once done, keeping default settings select the ESP32S3 Dev Module with suitable com port (may be different in your case) as shown below,

### 2. Installing Libraries
   - Download [library zip file]() provided here in github.
   - Extract and copy files inside Document > Arduino > Libraries folder. Make sure to restart Arduino IDE whenever you update or add any libraries.

### 3. Testing First Code
   - At this step you are all set to test codes, for easy getting started we have provided various demo [example codes]() in github which you can download and try. 
   - Open one example code in Arduino and make sure you have selected correct board with suitable com port, click on upload button to transfer code on ESP32 of Lo-Fi.

   - Checkout other examples below and build your own custom program codes using those references.

### Example Codes
Checkout below demo examples code for reference getting started,
   - [Example 1]() : Display Demo code
   - [Example 2]() : Send and Receive Data using onboard LoRa module
   - [Example 3]() : 

   Now you are ready to try out your own codes, **_Happy Coding!_**
