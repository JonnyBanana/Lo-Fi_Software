Lo-Fi combines ESP32S3 with LoRa to establish long-range wireless communication in challenging situations in addition to WiFi and BLE capabilities. With LoRa's great range and simple connectivity, you can talk with devices up to 5 km distant with ease. Device is available in three supported frequencies - 433MHz, 868MHz, and 915MHz bands for LoRa applications.

This GitHub page offers a step-by-step tutorial for using Lo-Fi.
